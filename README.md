## Introduction

The main goal of `urunc` is to bridge the gap between traditional unikernels
and containerized environments, enabling seamless integration with cloud-native
architectures. Designed to fully leverage the container semantics and benefits
from the OCI tools and methodology, `urunc` aims to become “runc for
unikernels”, while offering compatibility with the Container Runtime Interface
(CRI). Unikernels are packaged inside OCI-compatible images and `urunc` launces
the unikernel on top of the underlying Virtual Machine or seccomp monitors.
Thus, developers and administrators can package, deliver, deploy and manage
unikernels using familiar cloud-native practices.

For the above purpose `urunc` acts as any other OCI runtime. The main
difference of `urunc` with other container runtimes is that instead of spawning
a simple process, it uses a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) or a Sandbox Monitor
to run the unikernel. It is important to note that `urunc` does not require any
particular software running alongside the user's application, inside or outside
the unikernel. As a result, `urunc` manages the user's application running
inside the unikernel through the respective VM process.

## Quick start

The easiest and fastest way to try out `urunc` would be with `docker`
Before doing so, please make sure that the host system satisfies the
following dependencies:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/)
- `urunc` and `containerd-shim-urunc-v2` binaries.

Install Docker:

```bash
$ curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
$ sudo sh get-docker.sh
$ rm get-docker.sh
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Install `urunc`:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install -y git
$ git clone https://github.com/urunc-dev/urunc.git
$ docker run --rm -ti -v $PWD/urunc:/urunc -w /urunc golang:latest bash -c "git config --global --add safe.directory /urunc && make"
$ sudo make -C urunc install
```

Install QEMU:

```bash
$ sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm
```

Now we are ready to run nginx as a Unikraft unikernel using Docker and `urunc`:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -d --runtime io.containerd.urunc.v2 harbor.nbfc.io/nubificus/urunc/nginx-qemu-unikraft:latest unikernel
67bec5ab9a748e35faf7c2079002177b9bdc806220e59b6b413836db1d6e4018
```

We can inspect the container and get its IP address:

```bash
$ docker inspect 67bec5ab9a748e35faf7c2079002177b9bdc806220e59b6b413836db1d6e4018 | grep IPAddress
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
                    "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
```

At last we can curl the Nginx server running inside Unikraft with:

```bash
$ curl 172.17.0.2
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hello, world!</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>Powered by <a href="http://unikraft.org">Unikraft</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
## Installation guide

For a detailed installation guide please check [Documentation](#Documentation)
and particularly the [installation guide
page](https://urunc.io/installation/).

## Documentation

We keep an up to date documentation for `urunc` at 
https://urunc.io/ . We use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to
render `urunc`'s documentation. Hence, you can also have a local preview of
documentation by running either `make docs` or `make docs_container`.

In the first case, `make docs` will execute `mkdocs serve`. Take a note of the
url, where the docs will be served in the output of the command
(i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000). It is important to note, that `material-mkdocs`
must be installed. For more information, please check the [installation
guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).
Moreover, the pip packages `mkdocs-literate-nav` and `mkdocs-section-index`
should also be installed.

In the second case, a container with all dependencies will start serving
the documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Supported platforms

At the moment, `urunc` is available on GNU/Linux for x86\_64 and arm64 architectures.
In addition, the following table provides an overview of the currently
supported VM/Sandbox monitors and unikernels:

| Unikernel  | VM/Sandbox Monitor         | Arch         | Storage                       |
|----------- |--------------------------- |------------- |------------------------------ |
| Rumprun    | Solo5-hvt, Solo5-spt       | x86,aarch64  | Block/Devmapper               |
| Unikraft   | QEMU, Firecracker          | x86          | Initrd, 9pfs                  |
| MirageOS   | QEMU, Solo5-hvt, Solo5-spt | x86,aarch64  | Block/Devmapper               |
| Mewz       | QEMU                       | x86          | In-memory                     |
| Linux      | QEMU, Firecracker          | x86          | Initrd, Block/Devmapper, 9pfs |

We plan to add support for more unikernel frameworks and other platforms too.
Feel free to [contact](#Contact) us for a specific unikernel framework or similar
technologies that you would like to see in `urunc`.

## Running on k8s
